# Contributing to dcbfs

### Hello!

Thanks for considering contributing to dcbfs!


Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.


### What we're looking for

dcbfs is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community. There are many ways to contribute:  writing tutorials, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code to improve the security and accessibility of dcbfs.



## Ground Rules


First of all, we want this to be an open and welcoming envirnonment for all contributers. Please read our [code of conduct](https://github.com/darcymeyer/dcbfs/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for guidelines and suggestions.

Also, if you have a suggestion for a major change in the structure of the codebase, please open an issue describing the change insetad of a pull request (as that would likely be closed).


## Your First Contribution

A good way to start contributing is fixing small bugs and typos, and discussing the project structure/philosophy. This way you can familiarize yourself with the project before making larger changes.


### Never contributed to open source before?

Here are a couple of tutorials about how to make a pull request:

* http://makeapullrequest.com/ 
* http://www.firsttimersonly.com/
* https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github

Now you're ready to submit a pr. Feel free to ask for advice, we'd be happy to help!


## Getting started

If you want to submit a contribution, first make a fork of the repository. Make your changes on your fork, and when you believe your fork is in the best possible state, submit a pull request.


## How to report a bug

### If it's a security bug

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email darcy2252755@gmail.com instead and describe the exact steps you took and what was compromised.


### How to file a bug report

If it's not a security problem, please open an issue describing what happened.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

1. What version of dcbfs are you using (when did you install it)?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?


## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

### First, read the [README](https://github.com/darcymeyer/dcbfs/blob/master/README.md)

The outline and philosophy of this project is explained [here](https://github.com/darcymeyer/dcbfs/blob/master/README.md). If you have a suggestion or concern about the code, this is a good place to check if it is already addressed.

### Submit an issue

To suggest a new feature or enhancement, please open an issue describing it and why it is better than the current structure. We'll review your proposal and get back to you about possibly submitting a pr.

## Code review process

If you submit a pr, we'll review it and probably provide some feedback before merging it. Pay attention to comments and suggested changes. Once everything is perfect, we'll merge your pr.


## Contact

If you need to discuss something that isn't appropriate for a github comment thread, you can email Darcy Meyer (darcy2252755@gmail.com).
